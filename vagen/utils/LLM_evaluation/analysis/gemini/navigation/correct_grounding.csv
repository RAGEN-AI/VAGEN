Answer YES if the description matches the current state information, or NO if it doesn't.

# Context
You are evaluating whether an agent's description accurately reflects the actual state. The description must be both correct overall AND specifically relevant to the important elements of the current state. Generic observations (like ""player, box and target is on the ground"") that don't capture the meaningful relationships and positions in the state are insufficient. The description should demonstrate understanding of the specific configuration and relationships that matter for decision-making.

# Groundtruth Current State Information:
{'apple_position': (-128, 164, 36), 'drawer_position': (-500, -537, 200)}

# State Description:

The coordinates for both the apple and the drawer are identical in both the groundtruth and the description.  The only difference is the key names ('apple_position' vs 'apple', and 'drawer_position' vs 'drawer').  However, given the context, the minor difference in key names is acceptable as it does not affect the core information regarding the location of the objects.  Both descriptions convey the same essential information about the positions of the apple and the drawer. Therefore, the description matches the groundtruth current state information.
